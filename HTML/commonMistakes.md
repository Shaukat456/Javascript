1. ✅ **Real-World Use Cases**
2. ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

This gives you not just the "what" but the **"why" and "what to avoid."**

---

## 1. 🧱 **Document Structure**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Every website starts with this.
- Sets page title (shown in browser tabs).
- Loads stylesheets/scripts in `<head>`.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Missing `<!DOCTYPE html>` (can cause quirks mode rendering).
- ❌ Nesting `<head>` or `<body>` incorrectly.
- ❌ Forgetting to set `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, causing text encoding bugs (especially with non-English languages).

---

## 2. 📝 **Text & Content Elements**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Blog posts, documentation, articles.
- Hierarchically structured content.
- Lists for steps, quotes for testimonials.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Using multiple `<h1>` tags per page. Use only one `<h1>` (the main title), then use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. for subheadings.
- ❌ Overusing `<br>` for spacing (use CSS instead).
- ❌ Using `<b>` and `<i>` instead of semantic `<strong>` and `<em>` (bad for accessibility and SEO).

---

## 3. 🔗 **Links & Navigation**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Navigation bars.
- External resource links (e.g. docs, social media).
- Anchor links to jump to sections.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Using `#` as a placeholder and forgetting to replace it with real links.
- ❌ Using links (`<a>`) for buttons or actions (use `<button>` instead).
- ❌ Forgetting `target="_blank"` for external links—users lose their original tab.

---

## 4. 🖼️ **Media Embedding (Images, Video, Audio)**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Product galleries.
- Video tutorials.
- Background music or podcasts.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Missing `alt` attribute on `<img>` (hurts accessibility and SEO).
- ❌ Large media files without compression (slows page down).
- ❌ No fallback content inside `<video>` or `<audio>` tags.

---

## 5. 🧾 **Forms & Inputs**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- User sign-up, login, search forms, surveys.
- Newsletter or contact forms.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ No `<label>` associated with `<input>` (bad for screen readers).
- ❌ Forgetting `name` attribute—form won’t submit data properly.
- ❌ Using `placeholder` instead of `label`—not accessible or user-friendly.

---

## 6. 📊 **Tables**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Displaying pricing plans.
- Transaction history, analytics dashboards.
- Schedules, calendars.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Skipping `<thead>` and `<th>`—makes it hard for screen readers or dynamic styling.
- ❌ Using tables for layout (old habit—use CSS Grid or Flexbox).
- ❌ Not defining `border` or styling—raw tables often look broken.

---

## 7. 🧠 **Semantic HTML**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Blog articles: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`.
- Sidebars: `<aside>`.
- Website layouts: Better SEO and accessibility.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Using only `<div>`s—no meaningful structure.
- ❌ Misplacing semantic tags (e.g., putting `<footer>` inside `<article>` wrongly).
- ❌ Skipping `<main>`—reduces accessibility and semantic clarity.

---

## 8. 🌐 **Meta Tags, SEO, Accessibility**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- Setting up description/snippet for search engines.
- Page language setting.
- Supporting screen readers.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ No `<meta name="viewport">` on mobile—site breaks on phones.
- ❌ Missing descriptive `alt` tags.
- ❌ Using poor heading hierarchy (e.g., skipping from `<h1>` to `<h4>`).

---

## 9. 🎨 **Advanced Tags & HTML APIs**

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

- `<canvas>` for drawing apps, games.
- `<svg>` for scalable icons, charts.
- `<details>` and `<summary>` for FAQ sections.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Not providing fallbacks for advanced features.
- ❌ Using `<canvas>` without keyboard alternatives—hurts accessibility.
- ❌ Forgetting `data-*` attributes are for storage only, not styling.
